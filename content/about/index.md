# What is this portal about?
The MM Portal provides information and resources on MolSSI's ongoing projects for the molecular mechanics community. The portal also provides information on available Molecular 
Mechanics Interoperable [Components](/components) (part of the [MMIC](/mmic) project) that are separately hosted.

# How do I learn more about a particular project or package?
The best way is to visit the dedicated webpage for the project of interest and contact the developer(s). MolSSI's projects are typically hosted on [github](https://github.com/molssi), so we encourage 
the community to engage with us via github, or direct contact via software@molssi.org.

# How do I upload my own component?
We welcome contributions from the community to MolSSI's initiatives and projects hosted on [github](https://github.com/molssi). If you have developed your own component for MMIC, then we 
recommend you follow [this](/guide) guideline for hosting it on the MolSSI MM portal. If you encounter any problems or technical difficulties, we recommend you open an issue [here](https://github.com/MolSSI/mm_portal/issues/new).
