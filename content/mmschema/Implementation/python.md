# What is MMElemental?
MMElemental is an implementation of [MMSchema](/mmschema). Specifically, MMElemental is a python package that provides [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) [models](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/) for the molecular mechanics (MM) world. 
MMElemental makes it easy to standardize MM applications and workflows in python based on the MMSchema specification, and it provides interoperability capabilities that allow conversion between different representations of MM objects or file formats.
